# Testing_Task1
Introducing the Nenno's Pizza tests

For this three tasks were created:
cart_test.ts
browse_test.ts
drink_menu_test.ts

For the test I was using: Visual studio code, codeceptjs, Android Studio, Appium Server GUI, Appium inspector

For this test I was using emulated adnroid device via local Appium server
platformVersion": "11.0"
deviceName": "Pixel_3_API_30"

For running Nenno's Pizza application the source will need to be adjusted

However I ran into an issue when I had to compear images and I could not manage define the related actions
